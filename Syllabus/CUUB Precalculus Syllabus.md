**Course Description**

The goal of this course is to help students develop computational and critical thinking skills through introduction of topics covered in precalculus. Topics introduced in this course include functions (polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions), trigonometric identities and applications, vectors and matrices, and limits and continuity. This course is intended to provide a brief overview of topics covered in pre-calculus so students have some exposure before starting the official course.

**Course Objectives**

After completing this course, students should be / should have:

1) Students should have introductory knowledge of topics covered in precalculus
1) Students should be able to work in groups to successfully complete a mathematical project.
1) Students should be able to think critically about mathematical concepts.
1) Students should be able to provide written and oral communication on mathematical concepts and ideas.

**Grading**

**Homework:** 30 points

Three homework assignments will be given with equal weights. Students are highly encouraged to work in groups to finish homework; however, students should produce and submit their own work.

- Homework 1: 10 points
- Homework 2: 10 points
- Homework 3: 10 points

**Participation:** 10 points

During lecture, students will have to fill out lecture notes. Examples will be covered in class so students are expected to pay attention and solve along.

**Project:** 40 points

Students will work in a group to perform research on topics covered in this course. Students will have to read a published paper on the selected topic and perform research based on the ideas presented.

- **Written Report:** 15 points
- **In Class Presentation:** 15 points
- **Peer Evaluation:** 10 points

**Exam:** 20 points

**MID MONTH EXAM: July 5th!**

Exam topics covered from June 14th - June 30th will be on the mid month exam. This exam will be in class and students will have class time to complete the exam. This exam will be a written exam with no multiple choice so students will have the opportunity to get partial credit.

**Total Points:** 100 points
